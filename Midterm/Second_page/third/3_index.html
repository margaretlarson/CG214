    <p> This picture is of my Family; I am beyond lucky to call these people my family. They Always have my back, and are my biggest support group! I am one of five, three sisters and one brother. My love for Photography started when I was around 10 years old. My Father was the one who inspired me and got me to fall in love with Photography. As a little girl I always saw my father with a camera around his neck photographing whatever he saw that was interesting. I love seeing the final outcome and how beautiful the pictures were. The work that my dad was able to create inspired me to want to create something just as beautiful. I can’t give all the credit to my Father because my mother was just as amazing. Once she knew that Photography was my passion it became her passion. She always pushed me to do better and to create more work. She entered my work into contest around Long Island even when I didn’t believe it was good enough. She never doubt me for a second, she is and will always be my biggest cheerleader.
