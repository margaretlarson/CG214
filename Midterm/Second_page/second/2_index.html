    <p> This picture is of my back yard during sunset, Beautiful right? I am beyond lucky to have the water as my back yard. I am able to capture amazing nature photographs as well as wild life. By having this as my back yard I couldnâ€™t wait to get back home from school, or even for the weekends because all I wanted to do was walk up and down the beach and take photos of anything and everything.
