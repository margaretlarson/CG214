    <p> This is my little brother Nicholas! He is currently seven years old and is the craziest boy I know. He is diagnosed with Down Syndrome, but he doesn’t let that stop him from achieving his goals. He is the love of my life, and is a big contributor towards my photography. I love photographing my brother because he is so unique and the pictures that I’m able to create with him hold so much power and beauty. I look at him and see how dedicated he is to achieve his goal and to prove society wrong. His power and dedication is what pushed me to create more work that is stronger than the last
