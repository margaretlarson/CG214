            My portfolio is based in its entirety on the Human body, it is made up of two distinct parts. The first is a comparison of both a ballerina’s and a wrestler’s body whereas the second is a comparison of the human body with respect to nature.
 My inspiration for photographing the body of ballerinas and wrestlers stems from watching my boyfriend wrestle. During his matches, I found myself not paying attention to the score, but rather, I was intensely focused on both the wrestlers’ movement and how the sport is reminiscent of an almost barbaric dance. Further, I was able to envision a ballerina’s delicate, yet powerful, movement alongside that of wrestlers. Although the two are differ in a multitude of way, there is something inherently similar about the way they twist, contort, and utilize their bodies. Additionally, many see ballet as a beautiful art form but wrestling as a vulgar sport when in reality there isn’t much of a difference. With this in mind, I placed an emphasis on showcasing the beauty and pain that accompany both movement patterns while attempting to show that ballet and wrestling, although appearing to be polar opposites, are not so different after all. 
	Likewise, the second portion of my portfolio consists of a comparison between nature and the human body. One of my favorite photographers, Sally Mann, served as the inspiration for this view into the similarities between nature and the body. With this inspiration, I decided to create photographs that connected specific human body parts (the legs) to specific elements of nature (the tree trunk). I want to create a body of work that is as beautiful conceptually as it is visually.
